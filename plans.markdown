questions:
- |-
  #### What's early-bird pricing?

  To celebrate the launch of Siteleaf v2 and show appreciation to early adopters, we're offering a deal on our site plans. Sign up while we have early-bird pricing to lock in the price.
- |-
  #### How do subscriptions work?

  Each new site you create starts with a **free 14 day trial** on the Personal plan, no credit card required. At the end of your trial, you'll be prompted to select a plan. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time and your next month's bill will be prorated. Sites are billed monthly.
- |-
  #### Can I still use my legacy v1 plan?

  Yes! You can create a v2 site using your legacy plan, grandfathered in at its current price. Legacy plans are held to user and site limits associated with that plan. You can upgrade to a v2 plan at any time from your site’s settings page and cancel your legacy plan from your account page. You can also add v2 sites on top of your legacy plan if you hit your limit.
- |-
  #### Is there a cost per user?

  All v2 plans come with **unlimited users**. Invite clients, writers, and collaborators at no extra cost. For those on a legacy plan, user limits may apply (see your account page for details).
- |-
  #### What are the page and storage limits?

  Trial and Developer sites are limited to 100 MB and 100 pages, including posts and documents. Personal sites are limited to 500 MB and 500 pages. All other plans, including legacy plans, come with 1 GB of storage and unlimited pages.
- |-
  #### Where can I host my site?

  With v2, you can publish to Amazon S3, GitHub Pages, Rackspace Cloud Files, or any host that supports FTP or FTPS (Media Temple,  Dreamhost, GoDaddy, etc). Unlike v1, we no longer offer built-in Siteleaf Hosting. We decided to focus our efforts on being the best CMS and let others be the best hosting company.
